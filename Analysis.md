## Overview of Project
	Kickstarting with Excel is a crash course wher we learn how to apply formulas, create pivot tables, import data and analyze visualizations. This Kickstarter project is to help Louise with her crowdfudning for her new play "Fever"and give her insights on what she would need for the fundraiser. 

### Purpose
	Louise has a budget of $10,000 and needs information on how other crowdfunded theater productions fared with a range of budgets and find when the best time to launch a fundraiser would be.

## Analysis and Challenges
	During the analysis I found that with all the data ranging from movies to podcast, trying to crowdfund a play would seem difficult. Movies have a bigger budget and most of the titles get funded. Plays on the other hand were succesful if the goal was $10,000 or less. I found that the amount of data not pertaining to plays was not needed but I wias able to filter and get the information I needed. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
	During analysis of all theater productions, I found that crowdfunding was best launched during May and June had the highest success rate of getting funded. Where launching in November and December almost all of the productions failed.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
	After analyzing goals ranging from $1,000 to more than $50,000, I found that plays that had a budget of $10000 only had a 43% success rate and if Louise was to increase her goal to $20,000 she has a 75% success rate in accomplishing it. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
	No challenges were encountered in analyzing the data but Louise might find it difficult to crowdfund during certain times of the year. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
	First i found that if the crowdfunding was launched in May or June it would be successful. Also no shows were canceled during the month of October.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
	I found that plays that had a budget of $10000 only had a 43% success rate and it would be better to raise the goal to $20000 and have a higher chance of success.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
	There is so much information on other mediums when all I needed was information on Theater productions and it only had a few subcategories. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
	
A graph comparing Plays to Musicals would be helpful and a table to show the market in Great Britain vs. United states.
